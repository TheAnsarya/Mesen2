I need to create an announcement post for Discord about our Nexen release (the next one, not the current release) that acknowleges that we based it on Mesen but since the original author `Sour` has gone completely silent and there are no new versions, we made our version focusing on our major changes like Updating c++ from 17 to 23, dotnet from 8 to 10, modern code and practices, modernizing the c++, adding testing and performance benchmarks to the cpp and dotnet projects, heavily commenting and documenting, adding the pansy file creation, automatically saving pansy files (the pansy ecosystem is still growing and not 100% there), and save state changes to an infinite save model instead of save slots, and we will finish adding the TAS stuff for recording, editing, and playing "movie" files and such; and why we changed the name from `Mesen` to `Nexen`, which was to reflect that it's evolved ("Next") and that we'ved made so many changes and we don't want to imply that the Mesen project or Sour approve of any these changes and to distinguish it from the other version, and other changes; keep it tight

sour has only been gone since June, flesh out the descriptions of new features, maybe not so tight, pretend TAS movies is done and make a better summary paragraph

Nexen Release Announcement
We're releasing the next version of Nexen, a multi-system emulator for NES, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, PC Engine, SMS/Game Gear, and WonderSwan. Nexen is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. You can find it at https://github.com/TheAnsarya/Nexen.
Nexen is based on Mesen2, originally developed by Sour. Since Sour has not been active and no new versions of Mesen2 have been released since July 2025, we've continued development with Nexen to incorporate updates and new features.
Key Changes in This Release

Updated C++ standard from 17 to 23: Incorporates modern C++ features like smart pointers, std::format, ranges, and branch hints ([[likely]]/[[unlikely]]) for improved code efficiency and readability.
Updated .NET from 8 to 10: Aligns with the latest .NET runtime for better performance and compatibility in managed components.
Modernized code and practices: Refactored codebase to follow current best practices, reducing legacy patterns and enhancing maintainability.
Added testing and performance benchmarks: Integrated unit tests (using Google Test) for CPU instructions and other core components in both C++ and .NET projects; includes benchmarks to measure and optimize emulator performance.
Heavily commented and documented code: Added extensive inline comments and generated API documentation with Doxygen to make the codebase more accessible for contributors and users.
Pansy file creation and automatic saving: Introduced support for creating and exporting Pansy metadata files, which store disassembly and debugging information compatible with the Peony/Poppy toolchain. Pansy files are now saved automatically during emulation sessions. Note that the Pansy ecosystem is still under development and not fully complete.
Infinite save state model: Replaced fixed save slots with an unlimited system where save states are timestamped and organized per ROM in directories (e.g., SaveStates/{RomName}). Includes a visual grid picker accessed via F1 for browsing saves with screenshots and timestamps, quick save via Shift+F1, delete confirmation, and keyboard navigation. Legacy slot saves (F2–F7) are retained for compatibility.
TAS (Tool-Assisted Speedrun) support: Added features for recording, editing, and playing back "movie" files, enabling precise frame-by-frame control for speedruns and testing.

Why the Name Change from Mesen to Nexen?
The name "Nexen" reflects the project's evolution ("Next" generation) with significant updates and additions. We've made extensive changes to the codebase, and we want to clearly distinguish Nexen from the original Mesen project. This avoids any implication that Sour or the Mesen team endorses these modifications. Nexen builds on Mesen's foundation but introduces our own direction, including the features listed above.
For more details, check the README and COMPILING.md on the GitHub repo. Feedback and contributions are welcome.
------------------------------------
We're releasing Nexen (latest version: Mesen2 v2.2.0 - C++ Modernization + Pansy Export, dated January 31, 2026), a multi-system emulator for NES, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, PC Engine, SMS/Game Gear, and WonderSwan. Available on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
Get it at: https://github.com/TheAnsarya/Nexen
Nexen is a fork of Mesen2 by Sour. The upstream Mesen2 project has had no new stable releases since July 2025 (v2.1.1), with Sour largely inactive on updates since then. Nexen continues development by incorporating modern tooling, infrastructure improvements, and new functionality.
Major Changes in This Release

C++ standard updated from 17 to 23: Uses features such as smart pointers, std::format, ranges library, and branch prediction hints ([[likely]]/[[unlikely]]) for cleaner, more efficient code.
.NET updated from 8 to 10: Targets the latest .NET runtime for the managed/UI portions, improving performance and access to new APIs.
Codebase modernization: Refactored to current C++ and .NET best practices, removing outdated patterns and improving maintainability.
Testing and benchmarks added: Unit tests (Google Test) cover CPU instructions and core emulation logic in both C++ and .NET sides; performance benchmarks track optimizations over time.
Extensive commenting and documentation: Inline comments throughout the code plus Doxygen-generated API docs for easier onboarding and contribution.
Pansy file support: Added creation and export of Pansy metadata files (disassembly/debug info compatible with Peony disassembler and Poppy assembler). Files save automatically during sessions. The broader Pansy ecosystem (Peony/Poppy toolchain) remains in active development and is not yet fully mature.
Infinite save state system: Replaced limited save slots with unlimited timestamped states per ROM. States save to SaveStates/{RomName}/ as {ROM}_{YYYY-MM-DD}_{HH-mm-ss}.mss. Includes:
Visual grid picker (F1) showing screenshots and timestamps
Quick save with Shift+F1
Delete confirmation
Arrow key navigation
Legacy slot saves (F2–F7) kept for backward compatibility

TAS (Tool-Assisted Speedrun) features: Recording, editing, and playback of "movie" files for frame-accurate input sequences — fully implemented in this release.

Name Change Rationale
We chose "Nexen" to indicate this is the "next" evolution of the project with substantial internal and functional changes. It clearly separates our fork from the original Mesen/Mesen2, avoiding any suggestion that Sour or the upstream project endorses or is responsible for these modifications.
