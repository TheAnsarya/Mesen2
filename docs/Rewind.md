# Rewind Guide

## Overview

Rewind lets you move backward through recent gameplay to retry a section, inspect outcomes, or adjust inputs.

## Basic Controls

- `Backspace`: rewind while held or step backward based on active input mode.
- `Escape`: pause and resume while planning rewind and frame-step sequences.
- Backtick key: frame advance when paused.

## Typical Usage

1. Pause when needed.
2. Rewind to a stable point.
3. Resume or frame-advance to test an alternate action.
4. Save state when you find a better route.

## GUI Tips

- Combine rewind with save states for repeatable testing loops.
- Use rewind before creating a TAS branch to reduce setup time.
- Use the movie timeline and TAS editor for deterministic revisions.
